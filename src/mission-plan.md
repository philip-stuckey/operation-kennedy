# Kerbin Ascent 
- T+00:00: Liftoff

During this stage the Pilot must reduce the throttle as the ship ascends to 
maintain a thrust to weight ratio (TWR) of ≈2.0

- T+??:?? Pitch-Over

At an altitude[^altitude] of approximatly 10km, the Pilot is to ...

[^altitude]: Altitudes refer to the barometric altitude unless stated otherwise

# Mun Insertion 
- T+??:?? Mun insertion burn

Munar insertion will require a burn at T-??:?? seconds from apo-kerbin lasting 
approximatly ??:?? seconds and spending a total of ??.?m/s Δv
